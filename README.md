# ðŸŽ¬ SPRINT 3 â€“ Movie Data Processing with JavaScript & Jest

This repository is part of the IT Academy Bootcamp and corresponds to Sprint 3, focused on JavaScript array methods and unit testing with Jest.

## ðŸ§° Required Software

The following tools are necessary to run and complete the project:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- Jest (for automated testing)
- Jest HTML Reporter (to visualize test results in the browser)

Installation steps:

```
npm install
npm install --save-dev jest jest-html-reporter
```

## ðŸ§ª Methodology

This sprint applies the principle of **"programming to satisfy tests"**, where each function is tested using the predefined test suite (`films.spec.js`). The goal is to pass all tests instead of printing output to the console.

Each function was implemented following the **Single Responsibility Principle**, and code readability has been prioritized.

## ðŸ”€ Branch Workflow

This project follows a structured Git workflow using three branches:

- `main` â€“ contains the final, stable version of the sprint
- `Developer` â€“ used for active development and intermediate testing
- `Features` â€“ used to implement and test individual exercises or modules before merging to `Developer`

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6)
- Node.js
- Jest for testing
- Git & GitHub for version control

## ðŸ“š Exercises Overview

### âœ… Level 1 â€“ Mandatory Exercises
